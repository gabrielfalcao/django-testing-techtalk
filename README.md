# Example django project for DjangoNYC talk

This project contains the examples shown in my
[tech talk](http://www.djangonyc.org/events/78066272/) about testing
django apps.


## The code is fake, but the tests are real

The code inside this django app is totally fake, because the intention
here is just to show how to write tests.

Everything is mocked so that you can learn how to do it :)


## Instructions to run in your machine:

### Installation:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running unit tests

```console
python manage.py test --unit
```
